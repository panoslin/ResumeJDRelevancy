## Task 
Predict if a resume matches a job description using binary classification.
## Approach
Use a pre-trained SBERT model to obtain embeddings and build a classifier on top.
## Key Steps:
1. Prepare data and split into training, validation, and test sets.
2. Define a custom model that integrates SBERT embeddings and a classification layer.
3. Handle device assignments to avoid computation errors.
4. Train the model using an appropriate loss function and optimizer.
5. Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance and adjust as necessary.
