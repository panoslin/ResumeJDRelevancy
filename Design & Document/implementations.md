## Phase 1: Requirements Analysis & System Design

- Objective: Define project requirements, finalize system architecture, and plan for each component.
- Tasks:
	- Identify all key functionalities (e.g., data ingestion, NLP processing, scoring, search).
	- Design APIs and establish data flow between components.
	- Create data schemas for MongoDB and Elasticsearch indices.
- Best Practices:
	- Use UML diagrams or architectural sketches to visualize workflows.
	- Document requirements and assumptions; keep these updated as the project evolves.

## Phase 2: Data Ingestion Layer

- Objective: Build real-time and batch data ingestion pipelines using Kafka and Apache Spark.
- Tasks:
	- Set up Kafka to handle real-time streaming of resumes and job descriptions.
	- Implement Spark for batch processing of historical data.
	- Develop Kafka consumers/producers and Spark jobs for initial data cleaning and transformation.
- Best Practices:
	- Use modular design: decouple Kafka consumers and Spark processing for flexibility.
	- Ensure idempotency in Spark jobs to avoid duplicating data processing.
	- Write unit tests for Kafka producers and consumers to verify correct message handling.

## Phase 3: Workflow Orchestration (Airflow)

- Objective: Set up Airflow to automate and schedule batch processing and model training pipelines.
- Tasks:
	- Define Airflow DAGs for data preprocessing, model training, and periodic index updates in Elasticsearch.
	- Implement alerting on DAG failures to catch issues early.
- Best Practices:
	- Parameterize DAGs to make workflows adaptable for different data sizes and frequencies.
	- Use retry policies and alerts to handle task failures effectively.
	- Regularly update DAGs to optimize pipeline efficiency as the project grows.

## Phase 4: NLP Model Development

- Objective: Build and fine-tune the Sentence-BERT model to compute semantic similarity between resumes and job descriptions.
- Tasks:
	- Set up the Hugging Face Transformers environment and experiment with pre-trained Sentence-BERT models.
	- Fine-tune the model on a dataset relevant to job descriptions and resumes, if available.
	- Export and version the model to enable easy updates in production.
- Best Practices:
	- Use a train-validation-test split to monitor the model’s accuracy and prevent overfitting.
	- Implement logging for hyperparameters, metrics, and results (e.g., using MLFlow).
	- Track experiment details to make retraining easy as data or requirements evolve.

## Phase 5: API Development

- Objective: Create RESTful APIs using FastAPI to serve relevancy scores and handle data requests.
- Tasks:
	- Develop an endpoint for real-time scoring based on the NLP model.
	- Implement additional endpoints for data ingestion and retrieval, using best practices for RESTful design.
- Best Practices:
	- Document the APIs with OpenAPI (Swagger) and add detailed error handling.
	- Enable secure access with OAuth2 or JWT, especially if exposing APIs to third-party clients.
	- Set up load testing for endpoints to ensure they handle high concurrency.

## Phase 6: Search & Storage Layer

- Objective: Implement Elasticsearch for fast indexing and search, and MongoDB for metadata storage.
- Tasks:
	- Define Elasticsearch indices with appropriate mappings and analyzers for resume/job description data.
	- Integrate with MongoDB for additional document metadata management.
	- Build index synchronization routines within Airflow for automated updates.
- Best Practices:
	- Use Elasticsearch’s bulk API for efficient data indexing.
	- Optimize index settings for search speed (e.g., choosing appropriate analyzers, shard/replica settings).
	- Test retrieval accuracy and ensure search results align with relevancy scoring.

## Phase 7: Containerization and Deployment

- Objective: Containerize services with Docker and orchestrate them with Kubernetes.
- Tasks:
	- Create Dockerfiles for each component (Kafka, Airflow, NLP Model API, Elasticsearch, etc.).
	- Define Kubernetes manifests (Deployment, Service, ConfigMaps) for each service.
- Best Practices:
	- Use multi-stage builds in Dockerfiles to reduce image size.
	- Configure Kubernetes health checks and set up scaling policies.
	- Implement CI/CD for seamless deployment, including Kubernetes manifests.

## Phase 8: Monitoring & Alerting

- Objective: Integrate Prometheus with Grafana for real-time monitoring of system metrics.
- Tasks:
	- Set up Prometheus exporters for Kafka, Spark, Elasticsearch, and FastAPI.
	- Create Grafana dashboards to visualize metrics (e.g., response times, resource usage, message throughput).
	- Configure alerting rules in Prometheus for key metrics, such as API latency or Kafka lag.
- Best Practices:
	- Keep dashboards simple and focused on KPIs relevant to uptime, performance, and usage.
	- Use alert thresholds that reflect realistic operational needs to avoid alert fatigue.
	- Document metrics and alerts to ensure easy maintenance and troubleshooting.

## Phase 9: Testing and Optimization

- Objective: Finalize and optimize system performance, resilience, and scalability.
- Tasks:
	- Perform end-to-end testing of all components under different load scenarios.
	- Conduct stress and load tests for API endpoints and Elasticsearch queries.
	- Optimize resource allocation in Kubernetes, Airflow scheduling, and Elasticsearch indexing.
- Best Practices:
	- Use automated test suites with coverage across unit, integration, and end-to-end levels.
	- Implement caching strategies (e.g., using Redis) to speed up repeated queries.
	- Profile resource usage across components and scale accordingly.

## Best Practices Across Phases

- Documentation: Document each component and architecture decision as you go. Use markdown files, diagrams, and API documentation.
- Modularity: Keep services decoupled to make individual components easily upgradable.
- Security: Apply best security practices, especially for sensitive user data. Use OAuth2 for API access, secure database connections, and enforce strict data policies.
- Code Reviews & CI/CD: Regular code reviews improve code quality, and setting up CI/CD early will streamline integration and deployment.
