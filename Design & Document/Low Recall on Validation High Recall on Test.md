When analyzing the performance metrics of your models, observing a low validation recall but a high test recall can
indeed be puzzling. This discrepancy suggests that the model is performing differently on the validation set compared to
the test set. Several factors could contribute to this phenomenon. Below, I’ll outline the most common reasons and
provide suggestions on how to diagnose and address the issue.

Possible Reasons for Low Validation Recall but High Test Recall

1. Data Distribution Differences

Explanation:

- Sampling Bias: The validation set might not be a representative sample of the overall data distribution, whereas the
  test set is more representative.
- Class Imbalance Variance: The proportion of positive and negative classes might differ between the validation and test
  sets.

Impact on Recall:

- If the validation set has a lower proportion of positive samples or is skewed in some way, the model might struggle to
  identify positives in the validation set, resulting in low recall.
- Conversely, if the test set has a more balanced or representative distribution, the model might perform better,
  leading to higher recall.

What to Check:

- Class Distribution: Compare the class distributions in the training, validation, and test sets.
- Statistical Tests: Use statistical methods to check if the validation and test sets come from the same distribution (
  e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov test).

Solution:

- Re-sampling: Adjust the sampling method to ensure that the validation set is representative.
- Stratification: Use stratified sampling to maintain class proportions across all sets.

2. Small Validation Set Size

Explanation:

- A small validation set might not provide a reliable estimate of model performance due to high variance.
- The metrics calculated on a small sample size can fluctuate significantly.

Impact on Recall:

- The model’s recall on the validation set might appear low due to random chance rather than true performance issues.

What to Check:

- Validation Set Size: Ensure that the validation set is large enough to provide statistically significant results.
- Confidence Intervals: Calculate confidence intervals for your recall metric to assess its reliability.

Solution:

- Increase Validation Set Size: Allocate more data to the validation set if possible.
- Cross-Validation: Use k-fold cross-validation to obtain more reliable performance estimates.

3. Overfitting to the Training Data

Explanation:

- The model might be overfitting the training data, capturing noise rather than underlying patterns.
- Overfitting can lead to poor generalization on unseen data.

Impact on Recall:

- Overfitted models often perform poorly on validation data but might perform unexpectedly well on test data due to
  chance.

What to Check:

- Training vs. Validation Loss: Compare training loss to validation loss to identify overfitting.
- Complexity of the Model: Assess whether the model is too complex for the amount of data.

Solution:

- Regularization: Apply techniques like L1/L2 regularization or dropout.
- Simplify the Model: Reduce the complexity by decreasing the number of layers or parameters.
- Early Stopping: Implement early stopping based on validation loss.

4. Data Leakage

Explanation:

- Data leakage occurs when information from the test set is used during training, either directly or indirectly.
- This can happen if preprocessing steps are not correctly isolated between datasets.

Impact on Recall:

- The model may appear to perform better on the test set because it has indirectly “seen” the test data during training.

What to Check:

- Data Splitting Process: Ensure that the data splitting is done before any preprocessing.
- Feature Engineering: Verify that features are generated independently for each dataset.

Solution:

- Isolate Data Processing: Apply preprocessing steps separately to training, validation, and test sets.
- Re-split the Data: If leakage is detected, re-split the data and retrain the model.

5. Label Noise or Errors

Explanation:

- The validation set may contain mislabeled data, leading to inaccurate performance metrics.
- Labeling errors can disproportionately affect recall if positive samples are mislabeled.

Impact on Recall:

- Mislabeling can cause the model to miss actual positives in the validation set, lowering recall.
- If the test set has accurate labels, the model’s recall would be higher.

What to Check:

- Data Quality: Assess the accuracy of labels in the validation set.
- Label Consistency: Compare labeling criteria between datasets.

Solution:

- Relabeling: Manually review and correct labels in the validation set.
- Automated Anomaly Detection: Use algorithms to detect and correct mislabeled samples.

6. Inconsistent Preprocessing

Explanation:

- Differences in preprocessing between the validation and test sets can affect model performance.
- Examples include tokenization, normalization, or feature scaling applied differently.

Impact on Recall:

- The model might not perform well on the validation set if it’s not processed consistently with the training data.

What to Check:

- Preprocessing Pipelines: Ensure that the same preprocessing steps are applied to all datasets.
- Code Consistency: Verify that the code used for preprocessing is consistent.

Solution:

- Unified Preprocessing Functions: Use the same functions or pipelines for all datasets.
- Test Preprocessing: Validate that the output of preprocessing steps is as expected for each dataset.

7. Randomness and Variance

Explanation:

- Random initialization and data shuffling can introduce variability in model performance.
- The model might have converged differently during training, affecting validation results.

Impact on Recall:

- Variance in model training can cause fluctuations in performance metrics between runs.

What to Check:

- Random Seeds: Check if random seeds are set for reproducibility.
- Multiple Runs: Evaluate the model over several runs to assess performance stability.

Solution:

- Set Random Seeds: Use fixed seeds for libraries like NumPy, PyTorch, and random.
- Average Performance: Calculate average metrics over multiple runs.

8. Evaluation Metric Calculation Errors

Explanation:

- Errors or inconsistencies in how recall is calculated can lead to misleading results.
- Different thresholds or averaging methods can affect the metric.

Impact on Recall:

- Incorrect calculation can make recall appear lower on the validation set than it actually is.

What to Check:

- Metric Implementation: Review the code that computes recall to ensure it’s correct.
- Thresholds: Ensure that the same thresholds are used for validation and test sets.

Solution:

- Use Standard Libraries: Utilize reliable libraries like scikit-learn for metric calculations.
- Consistent Evaluation: Apply the same evaluation criteria across all datasets.

9. Model Selection Bias

Explanation:

- If the model selection is heavily influenced by validation performance, it might not generalize well.
- The selected model might perform better on the test set by coincidence.

Impact on Recall:

- The validation set might not be the best indicator for selecting the optimal model.

What to Check:

- Selection Criteria: Review how models are selected based on validation metrics.
- Alternative Metrics: Consider other performance metrics for model selection.

Solution:

- Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation to get a more reliable estimate of model performance.
- Multiple Metrics: Evaluate models based on a combination of metrics.

10. Temporal or Contextual Data Shifts

Explanation:

- If the data has a temporal component or changes over time, there might be shifts between datasets.
- Contextual differences can also cause variations in data distributions.

Impact on Recall:

- The model might perform differently if the validation set represents a different time period or context than the test
  set.

What to Check:

- Data Collection Time: Examine when each dataset was collected.
- Feature Drift: Look for changes in feature distributions over time.

Solution:

- Temporal Validation: Use time-based cross-validation if applicable.
- Adjust Data Splits: Ensure that the splits account for temporal or contextual factors.

Recommendations for Diagnosing the Issue

1. Analyze Data Distributions

- Visualizations: Plot feature distributions and class proportions in the training, validation, and test sets.
- Statistical Tests: Use statistical methods to compare datasets.

2. Review Data Splitting Methodology

- Ensure that the data splitting is random and stratified if necessary.
- Check that no data leakage occurs during the splitting process.

3. Evaluate Model Performance Across Metrics

- Look beyond recall and consider other metrics like precision, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
- Analyze per-class performance to identify specific issues.

4. Reassess Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

- Verify that all datasets undergo identical preprocessing steps.
- Ensure that feature engineering does not introduce leakage.

5. Validate Metric Calculations

- Cross-check the implementation of recall and other metrics.
- Compare results with those obtained from standard libraries.

6. Perform Cross-Validation

- Use k-fold cross-validation to obtain more robust performance estimates.
- This can help mitigate issues arising from small or unrepresentative validation sets.

7. Investigate Model Behavior

- Examine the model’s predictions on validation samples to understand its errors.
- Use techniques like SHAP values or LIME for interpretability.

Understanding Recall in Context

Recall is particularly sensitive to false negatives. In scenarios where missing a positive instance is costly (e.g.,
medical diagnoses), high recall is essential. However, focusing solely on recall can sometimes be misleading.

- High Recall, Low Precision: Indicates that the model is predicting many positives, including false positives.
- Low Recall, High Precision: Suggests that the model is conservative in predicting positives but is often correct when
  it does.

Balancing recall with other metrics ensures a more comprehensive evaluation of model performance.

Final Thoughts

The discrepancy between validation and test recall indicates that the model’s performance is not consistent across
datasets. By systematically investigating the possible reasons outlined above, you can identify the underlying cause and
take corrective actions.

Remember that model evaluation is a critical step in the machine learning workflow. Ensuring that your validation and
test sets are representative and that your evaluation metrics are accurately calculated will lead to more reliable and
generalizable models.
