2. ~~Improve Data Quality~~

	- ~~Data Cleaning:~~
	    - ~~Text Preprocessing:~~
	        - ~~Remove special characters, numbers, and irrelevant symbols.~~
	        - ~~Convert text to lowercase.~~
	        - ~~Remove stop words and perform stemming or lemmatization if appropriate.~~


	- ~~Consistent Labeling:~~
	    - ~~Ensure that labels are accurate and consistently applied.~~


3. Feature Engineering

	- Use More Textual Features:
	    - Combine resume and job description texts in different ways.
	    - **Extract key skills or keywords and use them as additional features.**

	- Explore Different Embedding Methods:
	    - ~~**Try different pre-trained models that might be better suited to your domain, such as models fine-tuned on**~~
	      ~~**job-related data.**~~


4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**

	- Adjust Learning Rate:
	    - Experiment with different learning rates (e.g., 1e-5, 3e-5, 5e-5).
	    
	    - Batch Size:
	        - Try different batch sizes (e.g., 8, 16, 32) based on your hardware capabilities.
	    
	    - Number of Epochs:
	        - Train for more epochs if the model is underfitting, but monitor for overfitting.
	    

	- Optimizer Choice:
	    - Experiment with different optimizers like Adam, RMSprop, or SGD.


5. Model Architecture Improvements

	- Try Different Models:
	    - BERT Variants: Use models like bert-base-uncased or roberta-base.
	    - Domain-Specific Models: Models pre-trained on similar domains (e.g., job postings, resumes).

	- Add Layers:
	    - Introduce additional neural network layers (e.g., a non-linear activation function like ReLU before the
	      classifier).
	    ```python
	    self.classifier = nn.Sequential(
	        nn.Linear(embedding_dim, hidden_dim),
	        nn.ReLU(),
	        nn.Dropout(0.1),
	        nn.Linear(hidden_dim, num_classes)
	    )
	    ```


6. Regularization Techniques

	- Dropout:
	    - Add dropout layers to prevent overfitting.

	- Weight Decay:
	    - Use weight decay (L2 regularization) in your optimizer.
	    ```python
	    optimizer = AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=2e-5, weight_decay=0.01)
	    ```


7. Data Augmentation

	- Increase Dataset Size:
	    - **Collect more data if possible.**

	- Synthetic Data:
	    - Generate synthetic resumes or job descriptions to balance classes.


8. Cross-Validation
	- K-Fold Cross-Validation:
	    - Split your data into k folds and train k models to ensure that your results are consistent.


9. Error Analysis

	- Inspect Misclassifications:
	    - Look at examples where the model is making mistakes to identify patterns.

	- Analyze Confusion Matrix:
	    - Understand which types of errors are most common (false positives vs. false negatives).
	  ```python
	  from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
	  cm = confusion_matrix(true_labels, predictions)
	  print(cm)
	    
	  ```


10. Fine-Tune the Entire Model

	- Unfreeze Base Model Layers:
	    - Allow gradients to update the weights of the pre-trained SBERT model.
	  ```python
	  for param in model.base_model.parameters():
	  param.requires_grad = True
	  ```

	- Caution: Fine-tuning the entire model can lead to better performance but requires more computational resources and
	  data to prevent overfitting.






Next Steps

1. Implement One Change at a Time:
    - Apply one optimization technique at a time to understand its impact.

2. Monitor Metrics Closely:
    - Keep track of both accuracy and F1 score, as well as precision and recall.

3. Iterate and Experiment:
    - Machine learning often requires multiple iterations to achieve satisfactory results.

4. Set Realistic Expectations:
    - Sometimes, data limitations or inherent task difficulty can cap performance.
